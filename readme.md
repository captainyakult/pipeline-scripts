These are a bunch of scripts that are specific to our server. The intended server layout is:

* $BASE/pipelines - list of pipeline software
* $BASE/sources - different sources
* $BASE/logs - logs of pipelines

Assuming the pipeline softwares run fine individually, the scripts in here should run fine as well.
